=================

This gem is intended as a direct replacement for acts\_as\_archive (AAA)
in Rails 3 apps with all of the same functionality and wrapping AAA's 
methods in aliases to maintain compatibilty for some time. Thanks to 
[Winton Welsh](https://github.com/winton "Winton on github") for his 
original work on AAA, it is good solution to a problem that makes 
maintaining audit records a breeze.
